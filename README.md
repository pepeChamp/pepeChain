# pepeChain
pepeChain For all poggers.

**pepechain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).


Eventho it built on cosmos-sdk but pepeChain is able to use EVM feature and also CosmWasm smartcontract,
for those who think Solidity is for weekling. You can try CosmWasm and have fun.

bash start.sh
```
or
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.
